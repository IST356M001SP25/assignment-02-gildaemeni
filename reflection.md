## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

This assignment was a bit challenging, but I learned a lot about working with text data, lists, dictionaries, and JSON files in Python. At first, I was confused about how to break down the packaging descriptions into a structured format, but after working through it, I understand it much better.

What I Learned
- Splitting and Parsing Text: I learned how to use .split() to break down packaging descriptions into smaller parts and store them in a list of dictionaries.
- Using Lists and Dictionaries Together: I now see how useful it is to structure data in a way that makes it easier to work with.
- Running Tests with pytest: I didn’t fully understand how pytest worked before, but now I see how it checks if my function is correct and helps me find mistakes.
- Using Git for Step-by-Step Commits: Instead of committing everything at once, I learned to commit my changes in smaller steps, which made it easier to track what I was doing.

What Was Hard for Me
- Extracting the Last Packaging Level: My function didn’t handle the last packaging container correctly at first, so I had to fix that part.
- Fixing Test Errors: When my tests failed, I wasn’t sure why at first. I had to print out the expected vs. actual results to figure out the problem.
- Understanding Error Messages: The "invalid literal for int()" error confused me for a while. I realized it was happening because my code was trying to convert something that wasn’t a number.

What I Need to Practice More
- Handling Different Text Formats: I want to get better at writing code that works with different kinds of text input, not just this assignment’s format.
- Debugging Test Failures Faster: I need more practice reading error messages so I can fix mistakes more quickly.
- Making Better Git Commits: Now that I understand how to commit in steps, I want to improve how I write commit messages and organize my work.
- Practice More Text Parsing: I’ll try writing small programs that extract information from messy text data.
- Write My Own Tests: I want to try writing simple test cases to check if my code works before running everything at once.
